     DESCRIPTION
          c-routines for reading and writing of big data-arrays
          from a FORTRAN program. Each data-array is written as one 
          file-record. The array is scaled on [0,4096] and the 
          resulting array is compressed as a grey-scale image using 
          the 'jpeg' image compression library. This reduces the 
          size of the data to approx. 5% of its original size.
          The resulting data-files are portable between different 
          architectures. 

          As the names indicate they should replace the FORTRAN
          open(2F), read(2f), write(2F) and close(2F).

     KNOWN PROBLEMS
          The accuracy is limited to 0.0002441 * (Max.value - Min.value).
          Jpeg compression is a lossy compression therefore an additional 
          error occures. With smooth fields compression is better.
          There might be problems with machines who don't have 
          a standard FORTRAN-C interface (i.e. multi-max, cray)
