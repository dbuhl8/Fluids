My current job is to design a stochastic forcing structure using the Gaussian random process. Gaussian Processes are a way of generating a regression from current data, fitting a line almost if you will. We are using gaussian processes to use the current data to inform a new point going forward in the code. 

The concept of the Gaussian Process is not a novel idea. Its purpose is to generate new points which fit onto an informed window of uncertainty around a given set of initial data. Ultimately, the process samples a gaussian distribution whose mean and covariance matrices are created through the use of precise linear algebra and a kernel chosen to optimize on the desired properties of the gaussian regression. 

The purpose of the Gaussian Process in the context of this work is to create a statistically stationary stochastic forcing in which to perturb and drive eddies in a stable manner as done in (Waite 2004) **SOURCE**. In our Spectral Code, the Gaussian Forcing was enforced on low horizontal wavenumbers as to affect the mean background flow, without directly interacting with the turbulence strcutures. 
\begin{align*}
    \vec{G}(k, t) &= <G_x(k, t), G_y(k, t)> \\
    \vec{G}(k, t) \cdot \vec{k_h} &= 0
\end{align*}

\subsection{Dealing with Finite Precision}
The procedure in which a Gaussian Process is generated is usually not a very complex Linear Algebra structure. The formulation is as below. 
\begin{align*}
    f_* &\sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_*, \Sigma_*) \\
    \vec{\mu_*} &= K_*^T \times K^{-1} \times f \\
    \Sigma_* &= K_{**} - K_*^T \times K^{-1} \times K_*
\end{align*}
Where, 
\begin{align*}
    K &= \mathcal{K}(\vec{x}, \vec{x}) \\
    K_* &= \mathcal{K}(\vec{x}, \vec{x_*}) \\
    K_{**} &= \mathcal{K}(\vec{x_*}, \vec{x_*})
\end{align*}
