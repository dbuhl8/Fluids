     NAME
          icwrite - write a record  on a 'ic'-formatted file 

     FORTRAN F77 SPECIFICATION
          integer function icwrite(iu,niter,time,dt,x,nlen)
          integer*4 iu, niter,nlen
          real*4 time, dt, x(nlen)

     PARAMETERS

         INPUT:
         iu     = file unit, can range from 1 to 25
         niter  = numer of model iteration
         time   = time of time  step
         dt     = time step 
         x      = data vector
         nlen   = lenght of data vector

     RETURNS
         0      =  fine

     DESCRIPTION
         icwrite writes the data vector x of length xlen to the 
         file with unit iu. The data can also be on a array x(nlen1,nlen2)
         with nlen = nlen1*nlen2. 
         For a short description of the alogorithm see ictools(3).

     KNOWN PROBLEMS
         The filenames must be character*7.
