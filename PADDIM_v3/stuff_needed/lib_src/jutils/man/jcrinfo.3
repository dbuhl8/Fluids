     NAME
          jcrinfo - read the information record  from  a 'jc'-formatted 
                    file 

     FORTRAN F77 SPECIFICATION
          integer function jcrinfo(iu,ra,ras,iddc,rle,numx,numy, numz)
          integer*4 iu, iddc, numx, numy, numz
          real*4    ra, ras, rle

     PARAMETERS

         INPUT:
         iu     = file unit, can range from 1 to 25

         OUTPUT:
         ra     = thermal Rayleigh number
         ras    = chemical Rayleigh number
         niter  = numer of model iteration
         iddc   = double-diffusive convection 0 = .false., 1 = .true.
         rle    = the lewis number
         numx   = number of point in x-direction
         numy   = number of point in y-direction
         numz   = number of point in z-direction

     RETURNS
         0      =  fine

     DESCRIPTION
