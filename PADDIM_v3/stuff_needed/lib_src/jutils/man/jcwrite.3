     NAME
          jcwrite - write a record  on a 'jc'-formatted file 

     FORTRAN F77 SPECIFICATION
          integer function jcwrite(iu,magic,niter,time,dt,x,numx,numy,numz,quality)
          integer*4 iu, niter,magic,numx,numy,numz,quality
          real*4 time, dt, x(nlen)

     PARAMETERS

         INPUT:
         iu     = file unit, can range from 1 to 25
	 magic  = magic number
         niter  = numer of model iteration
         time   = time of time  step
         dt     = time step 
         x      = data vector
         numx   = number of point in x-direction
         numy   = number of point in y-direction
         numz   = number of point in z-direction
	 quality= compression factor for data-file; low 
                  values mean high compression; usfull values 
                  are between 15-85


     RETURNS
         0      =  fine

     DESCRIPTION
         jcwrite writes the data vector x of length numx*numy*numz to the 
         file with unit iu. The data can also be on a array x(numx,numy,numz).
