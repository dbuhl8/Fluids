Gaussian Processes

My current job is to design a stochastic forcing structure using the Gaussian random process. Gaussian
Processes are a way of generating a regression from current data, fitting a line almost if you will. We are
using gaussian processes to use the current data to inform a new point going forward in the code.
The concept of the Gaussian Process is not a novel idea. Its purpose is to generate new points which fit
onto an informed window of uncertainty around a given set of initial data. Ultimately, the process samples
a gaussian distribution whose mean and covariance matrices are created through the use of precise linear
algebra and a kernel chosen to optimize on the desired properties of the gaussian regression.
The purpose of the Gaussian Process in the context of this work is to create a statistically stationary stochastic forcing in which to perturb and drive eddies in a stable manner as done in (Waite 2004)
**SOURCE**. In our Spectral Code, the Gaussian Forcing was enforced on low horizontal wavenumbers as
to affect the mean background flow, without directly interacting with the turbulence strcutures.

Dealing with Finite Precision

The procedure in which a Gaussian Process is generated is usually not a very complex Linear Algebra
structure. The formulation is as below.
f∗ ∼ N (µ∗ , Σ∗ )
µ⃗∗ = K∗T × K −1 × f
Σ∗ = K∗∗ − K∗T × K −1 × K∗
Where,
K = K(⃗x, ⃗x)
K∗ = K(⃗x, x⃗∗ )
K∗∗ = K(x⃗∗ , x⃗∗ )
