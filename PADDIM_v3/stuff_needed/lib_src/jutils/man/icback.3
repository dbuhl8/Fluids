     FORTRAN F77 SPECIFICATION
          integer function icback(iu,nskip,len)
          integer*4 iu, nskip, len

     PARAMETERS

         INPUT:
         iu     = file unit, can range from 1 to 25
         nskip  = number of steps to  rewind
         len    = length of last step in bytes

     RETURNS
         0      =  fine

     DESCRIPTION
         icback  rewinds  1 or more records on a 'ic'-formatted file.

     KNOWN PROBLEMS
         icback needs the length 'len' of the record in bytes. Therefore
         a icskip has to be done in advance in order to know the length.
