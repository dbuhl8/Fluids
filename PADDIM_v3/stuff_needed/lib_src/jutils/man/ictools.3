          icopen, icwinfo, icwrite, icskip, icrinfo, icread, icback, 
          icclose

     DESCRIPTION
          c-routines for reading and writing of big data-arrays
          from a FORTRAN program. Each data-array is written as one 
          file-record. The array is scaled on [0,65535] and each 
          data-value is written as 2 characters (16 bit !!).
          The resulting data-files are portable between different 
          architectures and do not contain any redundant information.
          Therefore compress(1) and friends does not affect the file.

          As the names indicate they should replace the FORTRAN
          open(2F), read(2f), write(2F) and close(2F).

     KNOWN PROBLEMS
          The accuracy is limited to 0.000015 times (Max.value - Min.value).
          The filenames must be character*7.
          There might be problems with machines who don't have 
          a standard FORTRAN-C interface (i.e. multi-max, cray)
