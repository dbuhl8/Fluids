     NAME
          jcrinfo2 - read the information record  from  a 'jc'-formatted 
                    file 

     FORTRAN F77 SPECIFICATION
          integer function jcrinfo2(iu,numx,numy, numz, npde,ninfo,finfo,cinfo)
          integer*4 iu,numx, numy, numz, ninfo, npde
          real*4    finfo(ninfo)
          character cinfo(ninfo)*20



     PARAMETERS

         INPUT:
         iu     = file unit, can range from 1 to 25

         OUTPUT:
         numx   = number of point in x-direction
         numy   = number of point in y-direction
         numz   = number of point in z-direction
         npde   = number of pde's
         ninfo  = number of info-records (must be equal for all data-types)
         finfo  = array with real numbers
         cinfo  = array with character strings - the lenght does not necessarily
                  has to be 20 .. any lenght will do


     RETURNS
         0      =  fine
         -1     =  error

     DESCRIPTION
         jcrinfo reads the  information record from a 'jc' data-file.

     KNOWN PROBLEMS
         endo of character in strings is lost ..
