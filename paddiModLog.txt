First, 
change read parameter which is in the main folder to include rotational paramterers in the 

For IO you need to change , 
diagnostics, IO, netCDF IO

Grep All files to see where Rotation is mentioned, make changes there. 

think about k curled with forcing is it non-zero.

Log of changes in the Code along side git records:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------



Commit 1: first commit to the repo, added two rotation related parameters to the parameter file. Made a differences.txt to see differences in the parameter file. 

Files Modified: 
main/parameter_file



-------------------------------------------------------------------------



Commit 2: Added some ref logs to find the parameter structure. Also added rotational parameters into the read_parameter.f90 and parameter_module.f90 files. All CPU's should be able to receive new parameters through the MPI broadcast.

Files Modified: 
main/src/main/read_parameter.f90
main/src/parameter_module.f90

Notes for Commit 2: 
 -  Used grep to find all references to the word "parameter" in the source code. This output was stored in the file "parameterUseLog.txt" inside PADDIM_v2_beta/main/src/ 
 -  Also grepped the word "rotation" in the PADDI-rotation src code. This output was stored in the rotationRefLog.txt file in the PADDI-rotation/main/src
 -  In main/read_parameter.f90 I added the following lines to the name list group "input_values"
    /input_values/ Rotational_param
    /input_values/ Angle_rot_axis_gravity
Then added the declaration for those variables in the same fortran file above and added a broadcast and receive function for the same two parameters below. Once values are read from the parameter file. These two parameters are stored specifically in the R and Theta values. 
    R = Rotational_param
    Theta = Angle_rot_axis_gravity. 
NOTE: R and Theta MUST BE added to whether the rest of these coeeficieints are defined. Others are called B_therm, B_comp, C_Lorentz, D_visc, etc. R and Theta must be added for the memory to not throw and error during compilation.  RESOLVED: R and Theta added to the parameter_module where the rest of the coefficients are declared in memory. Again note, R is not a radius, but the rotational parameter, I think similar to Omega or F. 
 - R and Theta added to parameter_module.f90 variable declaration. 

Notes on File Structure:

parameter_module.f90:
 -  Found the root of the parameter work comes from the parameter module and is imported into other modules and routines from there. 
 -  The parameter_module.f90 folder uses the defprecision_module and reads the data from the parameter file using
 -  Variable kinds are generated from the defprecision_module as they are used in parameter_module.f90 without definition
 - Variable values are not actually written here. Only memory is allocated for these variables. I need to find where these are stored. 
 - It appears that the main/read_parameter.f90 file is the fortran script which apprently reads the parameters from the parameter file and sotres them (I assume in the memory brought into the script from the parameter file

main/read_parameter.f90:
 - A subroutine which seems to use NAMELIST to read parameters from the parameter file and then broadcasts them using MPI to all of the other cores. 
 - Namelist is a fortran 77 function which assigns names or variables to a group name. This groupname can be passed only into the following fortran commands. NAMELIST, READ, or WRITE. 
 - The namelist contains all of the names of our variables in order. 
 - All of the parameters are read on the master cpu and then the rest of the cpus receive the data from the MPI_Bcast command which is set to broadcast from CPU id 0. 
 - Some of the input paramters are printed back out on the master cpu at the end of the file but most of the PDE parameters are not read back out,only some of them.

Commit 3: Did more investigation into IO structure. Added some variable definition and output in IO module. Started working on the pnetCDF_IO module as well but have not finished.

Files Modified: 
main/src/IO/open_files.f90
main/src/pnetCDF_IO/pn_open_dump.f90

Notes for Commit 3: 
 - Added R and Theta to IO/open_files.f90 and to the vectors finfo, cinfo defined within open_files.f90. Adjusted length of finfo and cinfo files accordinly. 
 - Added R and Theta to pnetCDF_IO/pn_open_dump.f90 variable declarations. pn_check subroutine calls for both parameters has not yet been integrated. 

Notes on File Structure: 

pnetNDF_IO Directory: 
 - parameter reference only in the following files:
    pn_open_dump.f90 - 4 references / variable
    pn_open_simdat_file.f90 - 3 ref / var
    pn_read_size_and_pa_from_dump.f90 - 5 ref / var
    pn_read_size_and_pa_from_dump_hydro.f90 - 5 ref / var
    pn_read_size_and_pa_from_simdat.f90 - 5 ref / var

pnetCDF_IO/pn_open_dump.f90: 
 - parameters are read in from parameter_module and then are referenced in the pn_check subroutine. There is an individual subroutine call for each parameter adn it seems that each parameter has an associated *_varid_dump. For example D_therm has D_therm_varid_dump inside the pn_check subroutine call.
 - there is a layering. Inside the pn_checks for each parameter, one is for the nfmpi_def_var function and the other is for the nfmpi_put_att_text function. Each call is related in some fashion to ncid_dump, whether this is analogous to cpuid or not I'm not sure. 
 - Need to determine what pn_check, nfmpi_def_var, and nfmpi_put_att_text do. pn_check likely comes from "pnetcdf.inc" and the nfmpi functions likely come from "mpi.h" or MPI module. 
 - Later, around line 200, another pn_check routine is called for each parameter. This time with PM_NFMPI_PUT_VAR_FLOAT as the inner function. 


IO Directory: used to tidy up the IO_module.f90 
 - for parameter IO the only important files are below: 
    open_files.f90

IO/open_files.f90
 - parameters are read from parameter_module and then written out. 
 - Two arrays declared: finfo, cinfo containing parameter data. 
 - Calls netCDF subroutines. I don't understand their purpose yet or if it is related to the parameters at all. 

 - read_parameter is called stored in main_module.f90 and so any file that uses this module will include it. Prog.f90 includes main_module and calls the read_parameter file.
 - Something interesting in the prog.f90 file is the way it creates variables for u, B, Temp, and Chem. They are declared by the following line of code.  
    TYPE(velocity) :: u
    TYPE(field)    :: B ! PH
    TYPE(buoyancy) :: Temp,Chem
   Brief investigation shows that this is a derived datatype and an initialization process must be undergone for the variable to function properly. This is most likely done in the "init" subroutine later called within prog.f90. "init" is found in main_module.f90 but might not be defined there. This is of concern for later as stochastic forcing shouldn't require a new type of field / variable to be initialized in prog.f90
 - List of files where Theta is directly listed in PADDI-rot is as follows: 
    IO/open_files
    main/ineffi_crhs_velocity.f90
    main/crhs_velocity.f90
 - Look into why there is a Sin_theta and Cos_theta variable stored in PADDI-rot



--------------------------------------------------------------------------



Commit 4: Modified more of the pnetCDF_IO files. pnetCDF_IO/pn_open_dump.f90, pn_open_simdat_file.f90; pnetCDF_IO_module. Understanding more of the pnetcdf structure as it differs from the IO files.

Files Modified: 
main/src/pnetCDF_IO_module.f90
main/src/pnetCDF_IO/pn_open_dump.f90
main/src/pnetCDF_IO/pn_open_simdat_file.f90

Notes for Commit 4: 
 - Added R and Theta to pnetCDF_IO_module.f90 in variable declaration. This will make simdat and dump varids globally accessible to the rest of the pnetCDF_IO files. 
 - Added R and Theta pn_check subroutine calls to pnetCDF_IO/pn_open_dump.f90 (3 for each parameter)
 - Something to take note of. On line 206 in pn_open_dump.f90, there is a reference to the pervious last elements of cinfo and finfo arrays. They used to be of length 9 before adding R and Theta, they are now 11 elements long each. I don't know what line 206 is doing so I'm not changin it yet. This doesn't occur at the corresponding line in pn_open_simdat_file.f90. 
 - Added R adn Theta pn_check to the pnetCDF_IO/pn_open_simdat_file.f90. 3 calls to pn_check for each variable. One for definition, one for attribute text, and then one for the value. 


Notes on File Structure:

pnetCDF_IO:

pnetCDF_IO/pn_check.f90:
 - This seems to take in a status from the functions placed in the subroutine call and then if the status is something other than nf_noerr ( I assume a variable that stores a success boolean value )  then it prints the status and uses the "STOP" command.
 - Uses pnetcdf.inc module and defprecision_module

pnetCDF_IO/pn_open_dump.f90: 
 - The pn_check calls are becoming less confusing. Inside each call, there is a status returned by nfmpi_*. Essentially in pnetcdf, you have to instantialize the parameters in a weird way. This is something intrinsic to pnetcdf. I believe each function call, is actually allocating memory and perhaps even performing some other function, the onyl thing the user sees is the status returned afterwards. Essentialy, we are defining variables and such within a different programming structure and then seeing if they were processed correctly with pn_check. 
 - Each parameter has a *_varid_dump pair. This variable isn't defined in pn_open_dump.f90. It has to be defined somewhere else in the code, unless fortran can somehow run a function and declare a new datatype in there.
 - Using grep to find where these  *_varid_dump are defined is not helpful. No defintion is found. Looking at the module linking, it can only be in defprecision_module, mpi, or pnetcdf. Or defined by some other file inside the pnetCDF_IO directory, but this doesnt seem to be the case. RESOLVED: They are defined in pnetCDF_IO_module.f90 which lies outside of that directory. There is an implicity superclass structure on each module with a corresponding directory. 

pnetCDF_IO/pn_open_simdat_file.f90:
 - This file is very similar to the pn_open_dump.f90. This file declares all of the simdat versions of the code. I believe the dump files and versions are all to dump restart data into. (3 more references for each parameter in this file. 

pnetCDF_IO_module.f90:
 - global data declaration for pnet cdf files. All types of parameters are stored here and many different things are defined in this file. Each parameter has a simdat and dump id and is only referenced twice in this file. 
 - This is only for memory allocation and superclass / subclass orgnaization. It seems varid's are given in the read pnetCDF_IO files.

COMMIT 5: Finished pnetCDF module. Getting ready to finish Main Module. Neet to introduce rotation force in numerical algorithm.  

Files Modified: 
main/src/main/read_parameter.f90
main/src/pnetCDF_IO/pn_open_dump.f90
main/src/pnetCDF_IO/pn_read_size_and_pa_from_dump.f90
main/src/pnetCDF_IO/pn_read_size_and_pa_from_hydro.f90
main/src/pnetCDF_IO/pn_read_size_and_pa_from_simdat.f90

Notes on Commit 5: 
 - added theta = theta * pi in main/read_parameter.f90
 - Fixed pn_check call for Theta which as an incorrect reference to the wrong var dump id. 
 - Added R and Theta to the pnetCDF_IO/pn_read_size_and_pa_from_dump.f90
 - Added R and Theta to the pnetCDF_IO/pn_read_size_and_pa_from_dump_hydro.f90
 - Added R and Theta to pnetCDF_IO/pn_read_size_and_pa_from_simdat.f90.

Notes on File Structure: 
 - Other files that use the parameter module are the "State" Folder, "Testing" folder, "Main" Folder, "Diagnostics" Folder, "Diff_op" Folder

Main:
 - This module has several files which use the physics parameters. 
    read_parameter.f90
    AB_BDF3/timestep_AB_BDF3.f90, 2 ref / parameter
    AB_BDF3/CFL_AB_BDF3.f90, 2 ref / parameter
    RK2_CN/timestep_RK2_CN.f90 3 ref / parameter
 - Next step is to modify these files to include the rotation. This will probably come in the form of coriolis or centrifugal forces. 

Diff_OP:
 - This module uses the parameter module but doesn't access any of the physics parameters such as R, Theta, D_therm, etc.

Diagnostics: 
 - This module uses the parameter module but also doesn't seem to access any of the physics parameters.  

Testing: 
 - This module uses the parameter module but also doesn't seem to access any of the physics parameters. 

State: 
 - This module seems to use the parameter module in order to define u, T, B, and C better but it doesn't use any of the physics parameters either. 

pnetCDF_IO:
 - Files to modify still: 
    pn_read_size_and_pa_from_dump.f90 - 5 ref / var
    pn_read_size_and_pa_from_dump_hydro.f90 - 5 ref / var
    pn_read_size_and_pa_from_simdat.f90 - 5 ref / va

pnetCDF_IO/pn_read_size_and_pa_from_*.f90:
 - This file seems to read parameter info from the dump files and then check them against the current run paramters to make sure they match. This is one of the restart routines. This is identical for all of the read size and pa files. 



--------------------------------------------------------------------------



COMMIT 6: R and Theta should be fully implemented now. Going to attempt compilation on scratch directory.

Files Modified: 
main/src/main/crhs_velocity.f90

NOTE: Code compiled and ran, however the data created in OUT1 doesn't seem to creating the simulation we want it to. 

Notes for Commit 6: 
 - Added R, Theta to MAIN/crhs_velocity.f90
 - Added coriolis force to crhs_velocity.f90 using the force present in PADDI-rotation/crhs_veloity.f90

Notes on File Structure:
 - Looking at the PADDI-rot source code, I can see two files where they have R and Theta integrated as they relate to velocity in the Main module. Here is the list of references: 
    Main/read_parameter.f90
    MAIN/crhs_velocity.f90
    IO/open_files.f90
    parameter_module.f90

AB_BDF3/tmstp_velocity_AB_BDF3.f90
 - this file performs the Adams Bash

 - Made changes in State Module for both versions of PADDI to give them the same initial condition. 
 - Going to change the parameter_file of PADDI-rotation next. 

Notes on File Structure:
 - Initial Conditions are read from the State module.
