          jcwinfo2 - write a information record  on a 'jc'-formatted 
                    file 

     FORTRAN F77 SPECIFICATION
          integer function jcwinfo2(iu,numx,numy,numz,npde,ninfo,finfo,cinfo)
          integer*4 iu,numx, numy, numz, ninfo, npde
          real*4    finfo(ninfo)
          character cinfo(ninfo)*20

     PARAMETERS

         INPUT:
         iu     = file unit, can range from 1 to 25
         numx   = number of point in x-direction
         numy   = number of point in y-direction
         numz   = number of point in z-direction
         npde   = number of pde's
         ninfo  = number of info-records (must be equal for all data-types)
         finfo  = array with real numbers
         cinfo  = array with character strings - the lenght does not necessarily
                  has to be 20 .. any lenght will do

     RETURNS
         -1     = error
          0  = o.k.

     DESCRIPTION
         jcwinfo2 writes an information record on the data-file.
