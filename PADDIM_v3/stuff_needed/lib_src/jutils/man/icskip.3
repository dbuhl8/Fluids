     NAME
          icskip - skip 1 or more records on a 'ic'-formatted file 

     FORTRAN F77 SPECIFICATION
          integer function icskip(iu,nskip,niter,time)
          integer*4 iu, niter, nskip
          real*4 time

     PARAMETERS

         INPUT:
         iu     = file unit, can range from 1 to 25
         nskip  = number of steps to skip

         OUTPUT:
         niter  = iteration-numer of the last skiped model iteration
         time   = iteration-time of the last skiped time  step

     RETURNS
         l      =  length of last step in bytes

     DESCRIPTION
         icskip skips 1 or more records on a 'ic'-formatted file.

     KNOWN PROBLEMS
         The length 'l' of the record should be returned as a parameter.
         This would be more consistent.
